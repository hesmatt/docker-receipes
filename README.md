# Docker receipes

This is a repository that's containing multiple docker examples (receipes), with docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile and other needed files already pre-configured.

## What's the use?

I've decided to make this repository, because I was finding it myself rather difficult to make a proper project containing for example combination of phpmyadmin,php and mysql as something always wasn't working.

## What's the current list of 'receipes'?

The current list of all receipes is listed below, every receipe also contains own README.md file with more details, set-up informations and so on.

### PHP + MySQL + PHPMyAdmin + Composer

## How to run Docker?

This repository is mostly for a people that already know some 'super' huge basics of Docker, however, I'll include instructions on how you can boot-up docker on pretty much any operating system that's out there.

##### Windows
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

##### MacOs
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

##### Linux
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

(Based off of Ubuntu, however, the commands can be easily adjusted and used on any other distro of your choice.)

##Pull Request
Pull request are welcomed, as well as adding new 'receipes' into this project :)
